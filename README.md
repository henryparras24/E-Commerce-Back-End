This ecommerce app allows the user to keep track of items that could be in a retail store. An assortment of different tools were used make this happen! For starters MySQL allowed us to create a database. Node allowed us to seed it. The dotenv package allowed us to conceal sensitive information like our password! Express and sequalize together allowed us to spin up our server. Postman allowed us to test all of our routes!
